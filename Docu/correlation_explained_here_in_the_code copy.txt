With correlation values being large due to the summing of many products, setting an appropriate threshold (THRESHOLD) is key to detecting a new lap accurately. Here’s a step-by-step approach to determine and interpret maxCorrelation and set a reliable threshold:

1. Understand the Scale of maxCorrelation
The maxCorrelation value is essentially a sum of products, with each product based on pairs of ADC values in the referenceLap and currentLapData arrays. The maximum possible value for maxCorrelation will depend on:

The number of samples (windowSize)
The range of ADC values (from 0 to 4095 in your setup)
For example:

If windowSize is 100, and your ADC values average around 2000, the maximum possible correlation would be roughly

100×2000×2000=400,000,000.
2. Determine maxCorrelation Range Empirically
Run a few test laps and log the values of maxCorrelation at each calculation. By examining the data:

Observe the correlation values when the lap matches (should be high).
Observe the correlation values when there’s no match (should be significantly lower).
This process gives you a rough range, making it easier to set a threshold between the typical "no match" and "match" values.

3. Setting THRESHOLD
Once you have observed the typical range of maxCorrelation, you can set THRESHOLD to be just below the values that consistently indicate a match.

For example:

If you observe that correlation values hover around 300 million during a match, while "no match" values stay below 100 million, set your THRESHOLD to somewhere around 200 million.
4. Fine-Tuning
After an initial THRESHOLD setting:

Test the detection accuracy on multiple laps with varying speeds or conditions.
Adjust THRESHOLD slightly if you notice missed detections or false positives.
This empirical approach will give you a more intuitive understanding of the correlation values and help ensure reliable lap detection. Let me know if you’d like help with a logging method to record these values for easier analysis!
